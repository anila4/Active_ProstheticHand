# Active_ProstheticHand

### About: 
This is a repository of my prosthetic hand designs, which all rely on a similar principle. Within the arm is a myosensor to detect electrical activity in the muscle group it's attached to. The myosensor is connected to an arduino, which is connected to a set of servos responsible for moving the fingers. 
Different iterations may alter or improve certain characteristics of the arm (ex. new designs, different filtering circuits, etc.), and this is where those changes will be logged.

This is pretty much just a personal project of mine, since I really enjoy working with this sort of stuff. If anyone ever finds themselves wanting to try this out (or something similar), feel free to use whatever you may need, so long as you have fun with it.
